# 🍱 Food Donation Website

A web-based platform built during a hackathon to help reduce food waste by connecting people who want to **donate** excess food with those who are in need and want to **receive** it.

This platform allows anyone to sign up as a **donor** or **receiver**. Donors can easily list food they wish to donate, including details such as quantity, type of food, expiry time, and pickup location. Receivers can browse through available food listings, filter by location or food type, and request items that meet their needs. The goal is to create a simple, effective way to bridge the gap between excess and need in the community.
